# TC-SU-040 to TC-SU-043: Google Sign Up Tests
# NOTE: Maestro cannot interact with native Google Sign-In sheet
# These tests verify the button behavior up to the point of Google sheet appearing

appId: com.uzairv.pagekeeper
---

# Launch and navigate to SignUp
- launchApp:
    clearState: true
- tapOn: "Sign Up"

# Verify Google button is visible
- assertVisible: "Continue with Google"

# TC-SU-043: Google Sign Up - Loading State
- tapOn: "Continue with Google"

# Button should show loading state
- assertVisible:
    id: "google-loading"
    optional: true

# NOTE: At this point, the native Google Sign-In sheet will appear
# Maestro cannot interact with this sheet automatically
# Manual testing required for:
# - TC-SU-040: Completing Google sign-in with new account
# - TC-SU-041: Completing Google sign-in with existing account
# - TC-SU-042: Cancelling the Google sign-in sheet

# For CI, we'll just verify the button triggers the flow
# The test will timeout waiting for Google sheet, which is expected
